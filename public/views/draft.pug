                                    We will be sending a number of buses to schools within driving distance of Ryerson University. If we don’t have a bus going to your school or you are a student who needs to fly to RU Hacks, we will do our best to subsidize as much of your travel costs as possible. More details on this will be released once acceptances start rolling out!

                                    No worries. Prior coding or technical experience is not a requirement at all. RU Hacks is a fun learning experience. We’ll be having tons of beginner workshops, talks and as well as mentors to help you with your projects. Our goal is for you to leave RU Hacks having learned something.

                                .ru-section-content.
                                    No.  We do not allow participants to work on pre-existing projects. All projects must be worked on from scratch. You'll have enough time to make something you can be proud of. However, you are welcome to familiarize yourself with specific tools and technologies beforehand!
